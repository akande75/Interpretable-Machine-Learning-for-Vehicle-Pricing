**Interpretable Machine Learning for Vehicle Pricing**

This project demonstrates the application of interpretable machine learning techniques to predict vehicle prices using real-world data. The goal is to build models that are both accurate and explainable, enabling stakeholders to understand which factors drive pricing and make informed decisions. The repository highlights an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and explainability analysis.

Vehicle pricing is influenced by many factors, including make, model, year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, and overall condition. Understanding how these features impact price is critical for car dealerships, pricing platforms, consumers, and researchers interested in fair and transparent AI. This project emphasizes transparency, combining predictive performance with interpretable outputs to ensure results are understandable and actionable.

The dataset for this project is sourced from one of UK car sales company and is confidential. The data is provided as a zipped file and can be extracted for inspection. It includes features such as make, model, year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, transmission, and the target variable, price. Preprocessing steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical variables, and feature selection to ensure high-quality inputs for modeling.

Several models were trained and evaluated, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost. Linear regression served as a baseline interpretable model, while decision trees captured non-linear feature interactions. Random forests and XGBoost improved predictive performance while maintaining some interpretability. To further enhance transparency, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) were used to analyze feature contributions, and partial dependence plots were employed to visualize global feature effects.

The results showed that mileage and year of manufacture were the strongest predictors of price, while luxury brands consistently commanded higher baseline values. Engine size and fuel type also influenced prices differently across vehicle segments. Model performance metrics, including RMSE, MAE, and R², indicate that the models are effective in capturing the underlying pricing patterns. Visualizations of feature importance and explainability outputs provide clear insights into the factors driving pricing decisions.

This project can be run by cloning the repository, installing the required Python packages, and executing the main Jupyter notebook. Future work could explore deep learning approaches with interpretable embeddings, expand the dataset to include regional market factors, and develop a web-based interactive dashboard for dynamic price prediction.

Overall, this repository demonstrates the application of interpretable machine learning to a practical, high-impact problem, highlighting skills in Python, scikit-learn, explainability tools, and data visualization, and serves as a strong example of combining technical expertise with real-world applicability.
